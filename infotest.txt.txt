milestoneCase5
Test case for milestone test case 5, tests function calling and register arithmetic xd.

sample_program
Given sample program, tests mainly MOV

test_jmp
Tests for the jumping of the program counter through Register addition

test_MOV
Tests for MOV operand code, moving values to registers, Stack symbols and pointers

test_CAL
Tests for CAL operand code, calling to other functions to see if STACK symbols are still local

test_REF
Tests for REF operand code, and whether the address is correctly referenced and passed on

test_ADD
Tests for ADD operand code, testing if add registers correctly and if adding on program counter is correct

test_NOT
Tests for NOT operand code, seeing if the correct ouput was produced and printed out

test_EQU
Tests for EQU operand code, checking if it is equal to 0, assigning one, else zero

BUFFEROVERFLOW
Test if the program can correctly handle if the Stack buffer overflows

test_recursion
Tests if the program can handle recursion

test deepCall
See if the program can handle many functions calls linked together

test_loop
See if the program can handle a loop to countdown from 100
